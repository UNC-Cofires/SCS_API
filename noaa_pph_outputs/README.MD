These folders represent the PPH values gathered from "solvepph_noaa.py"

These outputs are from January 1st to May 31st 2025. 

They were done with the following conditions:

noaa_pph_nam211 : sigma = 1.5, grid_spacing = 80, rounded to 3rd decimal
noaa_pph_nam212 : sigma = 3, grid_spacing = 40, rounded to 3rd decimal
noaa_pph_nam215 : sigma = 6, grid_spacing = 20, rounded to 3rd decimal
noaa_pph_nam218 : sigma = 10, grid_spacing = 12, rounded to 3rd decimal

When running this in "pph_graphed.py", be sure to adjust scales appropriately (smaller grid sizes have intrinsically smaller pph values).
