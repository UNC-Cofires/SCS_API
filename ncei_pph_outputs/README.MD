These folders represent the PPH values gathered from "solvepph_NCEI.py" 

They were done with the following conditions: 
- ncei_pph_nam211 : sigma = 1.5, grid_spacing = 80, rounded to 3rd decimal
- ncei_pph_nam212 : sigma = 3, grid_spacing = 40, rounded to 3rd decimal

Both nam215 and nam218 outputs are very large (>10GB), and so I have only included both of these

When running this in "pph_graphed.py", be sure to adjust scales appropriately (smaller grid sizes have intrinsically smaller pph values)
